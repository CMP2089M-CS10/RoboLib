Originally used for teaching Robotics at the University of Lincoln, UK. The libraries are accompanied by a set of practical tutorials that might be used for development of similar activities by other institutions and individuals.\r\n\r\nSome more theoretical aspects and pedagogical issues related to development of Robotics courses at the undergraduate level are covered in the following publication.
