RoboLib
=======

The official project webiste: [http://gcielniak.github.com/RoboLib/](http://gcielniak.github.com/RoboLib/).

C# wrapper libraries for several robots including Rovio, Roomba and NXT. Originally used for teaching Robotics at the University of Lincoln, UK. The libraries are accompanied by a set of practical tutorials that might be used for development of similar activities by other institutions and individuals.

Some more theoretical aspects and pedagogical issues related to development of Robotics courses at the undergraduate level are covered in the following publication. If you find the included materials useful, please cite:

The current content consists of the following folders:
- documentation/ - Doxygen file for generating library documentation;
- src/ - wrapper classes for different robots;
