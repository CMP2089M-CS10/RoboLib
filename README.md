RoboLib
=======

C# wrapper libraries for several robots including Rovio, Roomba and NXT. Originally used for teaching Robotics at the University of Lincoln, UK. The libraries are accompanied by a set of practical tutorials that might be used for development of similar activities by other institutions and individuals.

Some more theoretical aspects and pedagogical issues related to development of Robotics courses at the undegraduate level are covered in the following publication:
Cielniak, G. and Bellotto, N. and Duckett, T. (2012) Integrating mobile robotics and vision with undergraduate computer science. IEEE Transactions on Education. (http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/6031/).

The current content consists of the following folders:
doc/ - Doxygen file for generating library documentation;
src/ - wrapper classes for different robots;
examples/ - example start up projects (VS2008 project files);
tutorials/ - tutorial files: documentation and sources (VS2008 project files).

More information should appear soon on the Wiki pages.
